Yappi agent is any artifact that uses the Yappi protocol to 
publish or retrieve real time data using a Yappi Network.

A yappi agent can be an application that runs as a window minimised
and shows the data as it arrives. For example, it can be an application
that displays results of the current matches played in the Champions League
and that updates results as they happen. For other examples of yappi agents
please refer to the document "Introduction to Yappi"

This document describes the expected behaviour of a Yappi agent. 

When a yappi agent starts it will first try to retrieve a list of Yappi nodes
that are accepting connections. These are yappi supernodes which can be contacted
using standard Yappi connection rules. (note: reverse connections are not implemented 
in the first version of the Yappi protocol, this means that supernodes are contacted 
by nodes , which are responsible of initiating the connection )
