HOW TO COMPILE YAPPI ON MICROSOFT WINDOWS 
BY USING WXDEV-CPP (MINGW32)
=========================================
SVN-ID: $Id$

Prerequisite
============
BakeFile - http://bakefile.sourceforge.net/index.php
	A cross-platform (compiler) open source makefile generator. (a subset of the Automake tool)

wxWidgets - http://www.wxwidgets.org/
        A cross-platform open source C++ GUI framework.

MinGW32 - http://www.mingw.org/
	A collection of freely available and freely distributable Windows specific header files and import libraries combined with GNU toolsets 
        that allow one to produce native Windows programs that do not rely on any 3rd-party C runtime DLLs.

wxDev-Cpp - http://wxdsgn.sourceforge.net/
        wx-Devcpp is an extension of DevC++ by Colin Laplace Et.al. This program helps you to create Dialogs and Frames for wxWidgets visually.
	With all the good features of dev-cpp, wx-DevCpp hosts a wxWidgets form designer with the latest wx library. The main intension of this 
	program is to fill the gap of the non-availability of a free, open-source, commercial-grade IDE/RAD for development with wxWidgets.

Dev-C++ - http://bloodshed.net/dev/index.html
        Bloodshed Dev-C++ is a full-featured Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for the C/C++ programming language. It uses Mingw port of 
	GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) as its compiler. It creates native Win32 executables, either console or GUI. Dev-C++ can also be used in 
	combination with Cygwin. 

Setting up prerequisite software
================================
[wxDev-Cpp] Download: http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/wxdsgn/wx-devcpp-6.9beta_setup.exe?download  [28.70MB (including Dev-C++, wxDev-Cpp, wxWidgets and MinGW32)]
[BakeFile]  Download: http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/bakefile/bakefile-0.2.0-setup.exe?download  [2.45MB]

wxDev-Cpp Installation
======================
1. Execute the "wx-devcpp-6.9beta_setup.exe"
2. Click "OK"
3. Click "I Agree"
4. Select "Full". Then click "Next"
5. Put the program name displaying in the Start menu. Then click "Next"
6. Put the target directory. It requires about 134.9MB. ###Note: I recommend to use "C:\Dev-Cpp" even if it will mess your directory structure###.
   Then click "Next"
9. Click "Install"
10. Add ";C:\Dev-Cpp\bin;C:\Dev-Cpp\mingw32\bin"  at the end of the "PATH" environment variable. 
    ###Note: [My Computer]->[Properties]->[Advanced]->[Environment Variables]###

BakeFile Installation
=====================
1. Execute the "bakefile-0.2.0-setup.exe"
2. Click "Next"
3. Select "I accept the agreement" and then click "Next"
4. Put the target directory. Then click "Next"
5. Select componects and then click "Next"
6. Make that the "Add Bakefile to PATH environment variable" option is selected. Then click "Next"
7. Wait for installation
8. Click "Finish"

How to compile Yappi library & Yappi sample 
===========================================
[MS Windows][WXDEV-CPP] 
1. Open the command line [Start]->[Run...]->[cmd.exe]
2. > cd [YappiLib directory]\build
3. > bakefile_gen -f mingw
   ### Note: the step 1 and 2 need to be done just only the first of compilation ###
4. Open the "wxDev-Cpp" program. ###Note: [Start]->[All Programs]->[wx-devcpp]->[wx-devcpp]###
5. Open the "yappiSample" project at [Yappi directory]\yapplib\samples\yappisample.dev. 
   ### Note: yappisample.dev and yappisample.wxform are used exclusively for wxDev-Cpp. (no need for other compilers) ###
6. Select [Execute]->[Rebuild All]

###Note: the library will be created at "/lib" and the sample will be cteated at "samples/release" ###
