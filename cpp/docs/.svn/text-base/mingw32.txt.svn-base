HOW TO COMPILE YAPPI ON MICROSOFT WINDOWS 
BY USING MINGW32
=========================================
SVN-ID: $Id$

Prerequisite
============
BakeFile - http://bakefile.sourceforge.net/index.php
	A cross-platform (compiler) open source makefile generator. (a subset of the Automake tool)

wxWidgets - http://www.wxwidgets.org/
        A cross-platform open source C++ GUI framework.

MinGW32 - http://www.mingw.org/
	A collection of freely available and freely distributable Windows specific header files and import libraries combined with GNU toolsets 
        that allow one to produce native Windows programs that do not rely on any 3rd-party C runtime DLLs.

Setting up prerequisite software
================================
[MinGW]     Download: http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/mingw/MinGW-5.0.2.exe?download  [129.00KB + 16.50MB(Download during installation)]
[BakeFile]  Download: http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/bakefile/bakefile-0.2.0-setup.exe?download  [2.45MB]
[wxWidgets] Download: http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/wxwindows/wxMSW-2.6.3-Setup-1.exe?download [17.50MB]

MinGW Installation
==================
1. Execute the "MinGW-5.0.2.exe"
2. Click "Next"
3. Select the Country for downloading packages and select "Download as needed and install". Then click "Next"
4. Select "Current". Then click "Next"
5. Select "g++ compiler" and "MinGW Make". And make sure that the "MinGW base tools" option is selected". Then click "Next"
6. Put the target directory. It requires about 70.2MB. ###Note: I recommend to use "C:\MinGW" even if it will mess your directory structure###.
   Then click "Next"
7. Put the program name displaying in the Start menu. Then click "Next"
8. Wait for downloading and extraction. When it finishes, click "Next"
9. Click "Finish"
10. Add ";C:\MinGW\bin;C:\MinGW\mingw32\bin"  at the end of the "PATH" environment variable. 
    ###Note: [My Computer]->[Properties]->[Advanced]->[Environment Variables]###

=====================
1. Execute the "bakefile-0.2.0-setup.exe"
2. Click "Next"
3. Select "I accept the agreement" and then click "Next"
4. Put the target directory. Then click "Next"
5. Select componects and then click "Next"
6. Make that the "Add Bakefile to PATH environment variable" option is selected. Then click "Next"
7. Wait for installation
8. Click "Finish"

How to compile the wxWidgets (the compilation needs to be done before using the library)
============================
1. Open the Command line prompt [Start]->[Run...] then open "cmd.exe"
2. cd c:\wxWidgets-2.6.3\build\msw
3. mingw32-make -f makefile.gcc

###Note: to read more details about the wxWidgets compilation on Windows, please read at the "C:\wxWidgets-2.6.3\docs\msw\install.txt" ###

How to compile Yappi library & Yappi sample 
===========================================
[MS Windows][MinGW]
1. cd [YappiLib directory]\build
2. bakefile_gen -f mingw
3. mingw32-make -f Makefile.gcc

###Note: the library will be created at "/lib" and the sample will be cteated at "samples/release" ###
