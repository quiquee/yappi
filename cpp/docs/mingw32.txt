Prerequisite
============
BakeFile - http://bakefile.sourceforge.net/index.php
	A cross-platform (compiler) open source makefile generator. (a subset of the Automake tool)

wxWidgets - http://www.wxwidgets.org/
        A cross-platform open source C++ GUI framework.

MinGW32 - http://www.mingw.org/
	A collection of freely available and freely distributable Windows specific header files and import libraries combined with GNU toolsets 
        that allow one to produce native Windows programs that do not rely on any 3rd-party C runtime DLLs.

Setting up prerequisite software
================================
[MinGW]     Download: http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/mingw/MinGW-5.0.2.exe?download  [129.00KB + 16.50MB(Download during installation)]
[BakeFile]  Download: http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/bakefile/bakefile-0.2.0-setup.exe?download  [2.45MB]
[wxWidgets] Download: http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/wxwindows/wxMSW-2.6.3-Setup-1.exe?download [17.50MB]

2. cd c:\wxWidgets-2.6.3\build\msw
3. mingw32-make -f makefile.gcc

###Note: to read more details about the wxWidgets compilation on Windows, please read at the "C:\wxWidgets-2.6.3\docs\msw\install.txt" ###

How to compile Yappi library & Yappi sample 
===========================================
[MS Windows][MinGW]
1. cd [YappiLib directory]\build
2. bakefile_gen -f mingw
3. mingw32-make -f Makefile.gcc

###Note: the library will be created at "/lib" and the sample will be cteated at "samples/release" ###
