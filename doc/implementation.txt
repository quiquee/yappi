About the Implementation of Yappi
=================================

There is currently one unfinished implementation of the protocol using
perl, PIPOL or Yappi Perl Interface Protocol Official Library (aka Y-PIPOL)
PIPOL should be used to test other implementations of the protocol.

Implementations on other languages are encouraged. We are specially eager
to learn about working implementations that use C#, C++ or Java.

For support and help on the yappi protocol you should subscribe
to the yappi development group http://groups-beta.google.com/group/yappi_team
